This is a generator written in Python in an attempt to generate the
card sets similar to that used in the Dobbe card game, where for every
two cards, there must exist one but *only* one symbol that both cards
have.

It was written as a fun excercise trying to generate combinations for
Puchan's Mandarin Chinese classes.

The generator is not perfect at the moment, as it produces far less
number of cards with 50 distinct symbols and with 8 symbols per card
than the original Dobble game. Although the card set generated by this
code is much smaller, it is non-the-less a complete set, as one will
not be able to add a card to the set that does not voilate the Dobble
rules. It turns out that there are more than one solution to the
problem, and I have not been able to find the solution that produces
the largest card set.

It seems that this is a much more complicated and interesting
mathematical problem than I initially anticipated. If anyone in the
future is interested in improving the code, you are more than welcome
to.
